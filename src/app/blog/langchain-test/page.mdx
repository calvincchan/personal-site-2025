The code samples provided will demonstrate how to fetch a specific article from Wikipedia and then utilize the LangChainJS library to formulate precise queries that focus on specific details within the article. We will then pass these queries to OpenAI's powerful language model to obtain accurate and context-aware answers.

By combining the strengths of LangChainJS and OpenAI, developers can go beyond generic searches and engage in article-specific questioning, opening up exciting possibilities for applications in fields such as research, education, chatbots, and more.
