The Line Me Up project is an open-source waitlist management software designed for restaurants and retail stores. It aims to simplify the process of handling customer queues by offering a self-service approach for both customers and staff.

### Kiosk Mode

With Line Me Up, customers can easily join the waitlist through a self-serving kiosk or a browser in their own device, eliminating the need to interact with staff just to get in line. This reduces the workload on staff and provides a more convenient experience for customers.

### Station Mode

The system supports a station dashboard that allows multiple staff members to manage the waitlist simultaneously. Staff can view the current queue, call out customers, and mark them as served, all from a single interface. This helps to streamline the process and ensure that customers are served promptly.

### Public Waitlist Screen

Additionally, Line Me Up features a real-time waitlist status page that is displayed on a public screen. This allows customers to stay informed about their position in the queue without needing to check in with staff, reducing uncertainty and improving transparency.

Being an open-source project, Line Me Up is available for customization and further development by businesses and developers. The goal is to provide a flexible, adaptable tool that can be tailored to fit different use cases and contribute to ongoing improvements in queue management.

The project is available on GitHub at https://github.com/calvincchan/line-me-up, and contributions or feedback from the community are welcome.
