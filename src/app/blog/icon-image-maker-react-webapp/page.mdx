Just a quick and simple frontend for testing and building the image URL the Icon Image Maker Lambda function. It is built with React and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). You can easily control the parameters and see the result in real-time.

Note that in order to generating an accurate manifest of all icon packages and preview images, the icon packages must be coming from [@svg-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/org/svg-icons). You are welcome to add or remove icon packages using `yarn add` or `npm install` commands. Then, during the build process, the manifest will be generated automatically.
