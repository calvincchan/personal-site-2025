Recent trends indicate a growing adoption of AI-driven solutions to streamline the maintenance of existing React Native codebases. Developers are leveraging AI for tasks such as automated dependency updates, code refactoring, debugging, and even higher-level architectural recommendations, using both general-purpose and specialized code agents. These tools promise to reduce manual overhead, improve code quality, and accelerate update cycles, though integration challenges and the need for human oversight remain significant considerations.

## AI Integration in React Native Maintenance

AI is increasingly embedded directly into the React Native development workflow, offering capabilities from code completion to predictive issue detection. A [Medium article](https://emilykatherine124.medium.com/react-native-development-trends-in-2025-50bfc5e1aa80) reports that AI can now automate routine tasks, predict potential issues before they surface, and suggest improvements to code quality, leading to more efficient maintenance cycles.

### Automated Dependency Updates

One of the most labor-intensive maintenance activities—keeping project dependencies and React Native versions up to date—is being tackled by AI tools. [Builder.ai's guide on upgrading React Native](https://www.builder.ai/blog/upgrade-rails-and-react-native-using-ai) shows how AI can automate the entire upgrade process, including dependency resolution and test scaffolding, drastically reducing manual effort. Similarly, Digital.ai emphasizes the importance of automated dependency management tools to streamline security patching and library updates, ensuring that applications remain secure and up-to-date with minimal developer intervention [(link)](https://digital.ai/catalyst-blog/securing-react-native-applications/).

### AI-Assisted Refactoring and Bug Fixing

Beyond updates, AI-driven refactoring tools analyze code patterns to suggest performance optimizations and cleaner architectures. Workik highlights how AI can refactor legacy code by improving library usage and coding patterns, which enhances maintainability and scalability [[link]](https://workik.com/ai-code-refactoring). UnderstandLegacyCode.com notes that AI refactoring can be faster than manual refactoring, though it may require cautious, incremental application to avoid introducing errors [(link)](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/can-ai-refactor-legacy-code).

## AI Code Agents and Tools

A variety of AI agents and tools have emerged, each targeting different aspects of React Native maintenance—from command automation to multi-step bug resolution.

### Google's Jules

[Google's “Jules” agent](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318628/jules-google-ai-coding-agent-gemini-2-0-announcement), introduced alongside Gemini 2.0, is designed to fix bugs by generating multi-step plans and preparing pull requests for JavaScript tasks, including those in React Native codebases. While still in early testing and requiring developer guidance, Jules represents a significant step towards AI-driven code repair within large organizations.

### Cali: AI Agent for React Native CLI

[Cali](https://github.com/callstackincubator/cali), from Callstack Incubator, wraps React Native CLI utilities as tools for an LLM, enabling AI-driven project scaffolding and routine maintenance. By exposing standard CLI commands to a language model, Cali allows developers to offload tasks like component creation and error troubleshooting to an AI agent. Cali also offers a MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that can be used with any MCP compatible IDE: [(link)](https://github.com/callstackincubator/cali/blob/main/packages/mcp-server).

### Builder.io's AI Component Optimization

[Builder.io's recent post](https://www.builder.io/blog/react-components-ai) demonstrates how AI can propose architectural improvements for React components, optimize state management, and generate tests—directly contributing to more maintainable code. These AI suggestions are grounded in real code examples and can be integrated into CI pipelines for ongoing code health checks.

## Best Practices and Challenges

While AI tools offer significant advantages, developers must balance automation with human oversight. Key best practices include:
- Incremental Application: Apply AI-generated refactorings and updates in small, reviewable batches to manage risk.
- Automated Testing Enforcement: Integrate AI-driven changes into robust CI/CD pipelines with comprehensive test suites to catch regressions early.
- Security Auditing: Use automated dependency management tools to apply security patches and maintain compliance.

Challenges remain around trust in AI decisions, the potential for introducing subtle bugs, and the learning curve for integrating these tools into existing workflows.

## Future Outlook

The trend toward AI-assisted maintenance in React Native is set to accelerate, driven by the maturation of large language models and specialized code agents. We can expect deeper integration within IDEs, more sophisticated multi-step planning agents, and tighter coupling with automated testing frameworks. As tools like Jules, Copilot, and Cali continue to evolve, developers will find themselves spending less time on repetitive maintenance tasks and more on feature development and architectural innovation.
