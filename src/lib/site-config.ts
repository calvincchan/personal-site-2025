  intro: "I’ve spent 15+ years building software that makes life easier, from creating web and mobile apps to designing the back‑end systems that power them. My years of development work have taught me to build quickly, learn from mistakes, and embrace change. Now I’m bringing that same energy to AI and machine learning, exploring how language models, speech technologies and automation can improve user experiences and simplify complex workflows. I’m committed to blending my full‑stack skills with these emerging AI tools to build useful, human‑centric products.",
